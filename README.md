# BUILD IN PUBLIC

A developer-friendly community that lets you create a complete project in collaboration with others and build in public. Whether you are a new or a seasoned developer, you can pick a project, form a team, and start building the project in stages. This helps new developers escape the "tutorial hell" and begin constructing real-world projects that boost their confidence when applying for a new job. For experienced developers, they can learn a new skill quickly while working on their current job.
