# BUILD IN PUBLIC

A developer-friendly community that lets you create a complete project in collaboration with others and build in public. Whether you are a new or a seasoned developer, you can pick a project, form a team, and start building the project in stages. This helps new developers escape the "tutorial hell" and begin constructing real-world projects that boost their confidence when applying for a new job. For experienced developers, they can learn a new skill quickly while working on their current job.

## Categories

All the top-level directories in this repo represent a category that a project can be listed under. All of them have three project levels: 1st for beginners, 2nd for intermediate, and 3rd for advanced applications.

If you believe there could be more categories, join the community and share your suggestions.
